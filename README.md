# :airplane: Airplane Wildlife Strikes Project

### Business Task
Make a dashboard using Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data on collisions between wildlife and airplanes in the US.

### Data Set
* Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Wildlife Airstrikes (original source downloaded from [Tableau Public resources](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources) > Sample Data > FAA Wildlife Strikes, 2015)(.xlsx)
* Busiest US airports by passenger traffic (2014) dataset [(source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_airports_by_passenger_traffic_(2010â€“2015))

### Highlights
- 94.7% out of over 28,000 wildlife strikes on airplanes recorded between 2001-2015 ended up costing airlines and airports $0 in aircraft repairs.
- The remaining 5.3% of collisions account for over $100 billion of damage in addition to the countless animal deaths incurred by collisions.
- The LaGuardia Airport in New York sustained the highest amount of damage with $42,215,875.
- The Dallas/Fort Worth Internationl Airport in Texas has sustained the highest number of strikes with 877 strike.
